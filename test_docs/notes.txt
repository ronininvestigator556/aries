Research Notes - December 2025

Topic: Large Language Models

Key Points:
- LLMs are trained on massive amounts of text data
- Transformer architecture revolutionized natural language processing
- Self-attention mechanism allows models to weigh importance of different words
- Pre-training on general text, then fine-tuning for specific tasks
- Common models: GPT (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), LLaMA (Meta)

Challenges:
- High computational costs for training and inference
- Hallucinations - models sometimes generate plausible but incorrect information
- Bias in training data can lead to biased outputs
- Context window limitations
- Difficulty in reasoning and multi-step problem solving

Future Directions:
- Multimodal models (text, images, audio)
- More efficient architectures
- Better reasoning capabilities
- Reduced hallucinations
- Smaller models with comparable performance

Applications:
- Code generation and assistance
- Content creation and editing
- Question answering systems
- Language translation
- Summarization
- Customer support automation
