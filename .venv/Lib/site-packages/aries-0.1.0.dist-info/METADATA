# ARIES — Agentic Research & Investigative Execution System

ARIES is a **terminal-native AI workbench** designed for **professional research, investigation, and operator-driven agent execution**.

Unlike typical chatbots or autonomous agents, ARIES is built for **humans who need to get work done**. It runs entirely on your local machine, using local AI models (via Ollama) to help you research, code, and analyze data with full transparency and control.

### What can ARIES do?
*   **Local-First Chat:** Talk to powerful LLMs without your data leaving your machine.
*   **Talk to your Data (RAG):** Index folders or PDFs and ask the AI questions about them.
*   **Web Search:** Search the internet and get summarized answers (via SearXNG).
*   **Guided Execution:** Use `/run` to let the AI build and execute a step-by-step plan for complex tasks.
*   **Full Control:** Every tool call and file edit requires your approval. No "black box" behavior.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
-   **Python 3.11 or 3.12 recommended.** Windows users should avoid Python 3.14 for now because binary wheels for optional libraries (e.g., `chromadb`, `numpy`, `unstructured`) may be missing and will trigger slow source builds.
-   **Ollama:** Install from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com) and pull a model (e.g., `ollama pull llama3`).
-   **PowerShell users:** Commands below avoid `||` and are safe to paste directly.

### 2. Installation (PowerShell-safe copy/paste)
Clone the repo, move into it, create a virtual environment, then pick ONE install target below:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/aries.git
cd aries
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
py -3.12 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Base runtime/CLI (no RAG, no dev tooling)**
```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e .
```

**Developer tools only (tests/linters, still no RAG)**
```powershell
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

**RAG features (document indexing/retrieval)**
```powershell
python -m pip install -e ".[rag]"
```

**Full stack (dev + RAG)**
```powershell
python -m pip install -e ".[all]"
```

#### Network/Proxy installs
- Corporate proxies: append `--proxy http://user:pass@proxy:port` to any `pip` command when needed.
- Restricted networks/build isolation errors: rerun the install with `--no-build-isolation` (e.g., `python -m pip install -e ".[rag]" --no-build-isolation`) after ensuring build tools are available.

#### Optional dependency behavior
- The base CLI imports cleanly without RAG libraries. `/rag` commands lazily import optional components and will show a friendly message telling you to install `.[rag]` instead of crashing when extras are missing.

### 3. Configuration
Copy the example config and check your settings:
```bash
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
```

### 4. Run Aries
```bash
python -m aries
```

## Core Philosophy

ARIES is built on four principles:

1. **Operator First**
   - Every action is visible
   - Nothing executes silently
   - Human intent always gates execution

2. **Inspectable by Default**
   - Plans, steps, tools, approvals, artifacts, and reports are reviewable
   - Runs are persistent and recoverable
   - Output withstands professional scrutiny

3. **Workbench, Not Autonomy**
   - ARIES helps you *do the work*
   - It does not decide goals, ethics, or outcomes
   - No hidden background agents

4. **MCP as a First-Class Execution Layer**
   - Desktop Commander and Playwright integrated directly
   - External interaction is deliberate, gated, and traceable

## High-Level Architecture

```mermaid

    Operator -->|Commands| ARIES
    ARIES -->|Plan| LLM
    LLM -->|Steps| ARIES
    ARIES -->|Gated Calls| Tools
    Tools -->|Artifacts| Workspace
    Workspace -->|Reports| Operator
```

---

## Core Concepts

### Workspaces

A workspace is a **persistent working environment**.

```bash
/ workspace open my_case
```

Each workspace contains:
- Conversation history
- Artifacts
- Run metadata
- Reports

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Workspace --> Conversations
    Workspace --> Artifacts
    Workspace --> Runs
    Workspace --> Reports
```

---

### Profiles

Profiles define **how the model reasons and communicates**.

```bash
/ profile use investigator
```

Profiles control:
- Tone
- Methodology
- Output structure
- Assumptions

---

### Agent Runs

A **run** is a structured execution session.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    IDLE --> PLANNING
    PLANNING --> RUNNING
    RUNNING --> PAUSED
    PAUSED --> RUNNING
    RUNNING --> COMPLETED
    RUNNING --> FAILED
    RUNNING --> STOPPED
```

Runs are:
- Stepwise
- Interruptible
- Inspectable
- Recoverable

---

## Approval Model

ARIES uses **risk tiers** instead of complex policy engines.

| Tier | Description |
|----|------------|
| 0 | Read-only analysis |
| 1 | Workspace-scoped writes |
| 2 | Desktop Commander / shell |
| 3 | Playwright / network |

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Step --> Tool
    Tool -->|Compute Effective Tier| Approval
    Approval -->|Allowed| Execute
    Approval -->|Denied| Pause
```

Approvals are:
- Explicit
- Explainable
- Scoped (`once` or `session`)
- Logged

---

## Typical Workflow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant O as Operator
    participant A as ARIES
    participant L as LLM
    participant T as Tools

    O->>A: /run <goal>
    A->>L: Generate Plan
    L->>A: Structured Steps
    A->>O: Display Plan
    loop Steps
        A->>T: Tool Call (Gated)
        T->>A: Artifacts
        A->>O: Step Summary
    end
    A->>O: Run Report
```

---

## Inspecting and Controlling Runs

### Inspect

```bash
/ run inspect
```

Displays:
- Plan
- Step status
- Approvals
- Artifacts

Read-only view.

---

### Manual Stepping

```bash
/ run next
/ run continue
```

Manual stepping is ideal for:
- Desktop automation
- Browser navigation
- High-risk OSINT actions

---

### Editing a Plan

```bash
/ run pause
/ run edit
```

Operators can:
- Rename steps
- Adjust intent
- Reorder steps
- Change risk tiers

All edits are audited.

---

## Artifacts

Artifacts are outputs from tools and analysis.

```bash
/ artifacts run
/ artifact open <id>
```

Artifacts are always traceable to:
- Step
- Tool
- Run

---

## Run Reports

Every run generates:

- Markdown report
- JSON report

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Run --> Plan
    Run --> ExecutionLog
    Run --> Artifacts
    Run --> Approvals
    Run --> Report
```

Reports are suitable for:
- Case files
- Client deliverables
- Legal review

---

## Run Recovery

On startup, ARIES detects incomplete runs.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Startup --> DetectRuns
    DetectRuns --> Inspect
    DetectRuns --> Resume
    DetectRuns --> Archive
```

Nothing resumes automatically.

---

## Example Scenarios

### OSINT Investigation
- Investigator profile
- Playwright browsing
- Structured reporting

### Desktop Evidence Collection
- Manual stepping
- Desktop Commander
- Traceable artifacts

### Technical Research
- Tier 0 analysis
- Documentation synthesis

---

## Design Guardrails

ARIES intentionally avoids:
- Autonomous agents
- Background schedulers
- Policy engines
- Web dashboards

ARIES prioritizes:
- Transparency
- Control
- Professional rigor

---

## Status

ARIES is operational and under active development.
It prioritizes correctness, control, and inspectability over novelty.
