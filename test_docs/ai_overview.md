# Artificial Intelligence Overview

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.

## Types of AI

### Narrow AI
Narrow AI, also known as weak AI, is designed to perform a specific task, such as facial recognition or internet searches. Most current AI applications fall into this category.

### General AI
General AI, or strong AI, refers to machines that possess the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a level comparable to human intelligence.

### Superintelligent AI
This theoretical form of AI surpasses human intelligence across all domains and is currently a topic of debate among researchers.

## Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

### Deep Learning
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers. It has been particularly successful in image and speech recognition tasks.

## Applications
AI is used in various fields including:
- Healthcare (diagnosis and treatment recommendations)
- Finance (fraud detection and algorithmic trading)
- Transportation (autonomous vehicles)
- Entertainment (recommendation systems)
- Customer service (chatbots and virtual assistants)
