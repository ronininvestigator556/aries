# Python Programming Basics

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.

## Key Features

### Easy to Learn
Python has a simple syntax that mimics natural language, making it accessible to beginners while remaining powerful for experts.

### Versatile
Python can be used for:
- Web development (Django, Flask)
- Data science and machine learning (NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow)
- Automation and scripting
- Desktop applications
- Game development

### Large Standard Library
Python comes with a comprehensive standard library that includes modules for various tasks like file I/O, system calls, and internet protocols.

## Basic Syntax

### Variables
In Python, you don't need to declare variable types explicitly:
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
is_student = False
```

### Data Structures
Python provides built-in data structures:
- Lists: ordered, mutable collections
- Tuples: ordered, immutable collections
- Dictionaries: key-value pairs
- Sets: unordered collections of unique elements

### Functions
Functions are defined using the `def` keyword:
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

## Popular Frameworks
- **Django**: Full-featured web framework
- **Flask**: Lightweight web framework
- **FastAPI**: Modern API framework
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation library
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: Machine learning frameworks
